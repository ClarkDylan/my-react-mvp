# MyBill Expense Calculator

This app was designed based around user input. When the user loads the page, the first step is to input their current account balance. From here, they click the [+] button to add a new bill or expense to the list. As this is done, their remaining account balance will be adjusted dependant on the amount of each bill.

The app was created using PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
